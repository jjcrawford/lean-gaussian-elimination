# lean-gaussian-elimination (Presentation & Report)
This branch of the repository contains a copy of the report and presentation I produced as part of a MATH3349: Special Topics in Mathematics project in Automated and Interactive Theorem Proving at ANU in Semester 2, 2018. The implementation of Gaussian Elimination here is the version that was up-to-date at the time the report and presentation were written, and will not continue to receive updates.

The master branch contains the implementation of Gaussian Elimination under active development, and anyone seeking the current version should look there.
